# GreenPlate: A Sustainable Food Management System

## Introduction

Welcome to GreenPlate, an innovative project designed to revolutionize the way we think about and manage our food. At the heart of GreenPlate is our commitment to promoting sustainable food management. This initiative plays a pivotal role in enhancing sustainable eating and shopping habits, empowering users to make eco-friendly choices that benefit both the planet and their health. Through GreenPlate, we aim to reduce food waste and improve food resource management by integrating smart technology and user-friendly interfaces into everyday activities.

## Design & Architecture

The architecture of GreenPlate is built on robust design principles and patterns that ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficiency. Below are the UML diagrams that provide a clear visual representation of the application's design:
